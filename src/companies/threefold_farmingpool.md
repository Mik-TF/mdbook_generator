## ThreeFold Farming Pool

A Pool of storage & compute hardware which allows to provision IT Capacity.

Each Farming Pool consists out of TFNodes which run the TF Operating System and TF Blockchain Software (TFChain) which allows anyone in the world to use this IT capacity to host their IT workloads (storage apps, archive capacity, web applications, artificial intelligence, iOT, docker containers, etc). To use this IT Capacity, through the TF Grid, people need to own ThreeFold_Tokens ("TFTs") as they are the only possible mechanism to purchase this capacity on the TF Grid. As such, TFTs represent a true utility.

- Installing & testing the TF Operating System on the chosen hardware.
- Burn in testing of the chosen hardware: make sure the hardware is reliable and works following expectations.
