# Solution

We need to work in steps and go careful to resolve the issues

## Phase 1

- Do crowdfunding from TF DMCC ([see here](redz/crowdfunding/cf.md))
  - This crowdfunding will pay for cloud services (see below)
- TF Senior Consultants help    
  - e.g. Jan, Azmy, Thabet, Lee
  - fix and improve issues. This service will be free.
- ThreeFold will host the solution on its decentralized and add required capacity fees will be
  - 10 USD per TB (2.5x less compared to Amazon, ...) transfer
  - 5 USD per TB stored
  - 0.1 USD per user per month
- ThreeFold helps to run the operations
  - will help build all required procedures.
  - will help build monitoring solution for infra and bandwidth
  - all will be documented in git based private repositories
- ThreeFold will decentralize in such a way to provide following benefits.
  - better uptime
  - more performance
  - less chance to be shutdown
- **ThreeFold will reach out to own network and help with crowd funding**


## Phase 1.1

Decentralized the current solution with minimal change for the appl developers, aim is to support 10m people.

- operational requirements
  - good backups on current DB
  - automatic daily restore on 2 chosen locations, these DB's are available but read only, so we know backup works
- technical improvements
  - use geo DNS to make sure customers have best possible accesstime
  - use redis as pub/sub mechanism, help developers to make change
  - install decentralized redis (so available in all locations)
  - host web front ends on +20 location capable to deal with load upto 10m people
  - roll out our own CDN on +20 locations

## Phase 1.2

Help developers to create the solution for 2.0 which will provide all required benefits.

Help RedZ with legal and financial advice, see which structures to create to provide safety for the team. Use legal team who is already working with TF.

## Phase 2.0

Introduce the Digital Twin concept and roll out the solution of the future which will introduce unlimited freedom while maintaining minimal required responsibility.

We believe phase 2 has the biggest chance to resolve the issues as mentioned before.
