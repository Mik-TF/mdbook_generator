# FAQ

### Decentralization


### Security?

- The protocols by itself have quite some security but this security also makes it sometimes just a little harder to use.

### Scalability?

- The systems are capable to be super scalable but because people don't want to operate themselves its somewhat more limited.

### Is the data secure and protected?

- Thanks to EarthHub we can store the data on a quantum safe storage system which will allow more reliability and security.
