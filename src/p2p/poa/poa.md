# Proof of Authenticity

Describe how the current way of liking people and giving ratings in the current social media network world is not good, how a system of Proof of Authenticity would be much better.

How does it work, every person can publish anything to everyone, when publishing there are the following levels of proof of authenticity.

Proof of authenticity is always expressed on 3 levels

what is the ability for the Author to act in line to

- Self Authenticity
  - never lie, don't pretend
  - capable to represent information without manipulation
  - act to the best of their own knowledge, capable to say they don't have certain informaion
- Planet First
  - is the author capable to put benefit of the planet first
- People First
  - is the author capable to give without expectations to the benefit of the community (people).

There are 3 ways how a vote can be done

- **positive**
  - means we agree and want to give our support
- **neutral**
  - means we are not sure, we don't wanna say yes or no
- **negative**
  - means we don't agree 



## Authenticity of Content

We can also upvote or downvote any piece of content (text, video, ...) in line to above 3 dimensions.

This helps to give an indication to the reader.

A Circle is combination of many pieces of information, the roll up of these votes can be shown on that level, we can do the same for an author.

In other words its easy to see for anyone to see what an experienced Authenticity level is on each of shose levels.

Example: an author has written 10 articles and 10 video's, 100 votes have been given, 20 down votes, 80 plus votes on authenticity, 10 votes for planet first, 50-50%, 10 votes for people first 30% positive. The result as shown for an Author or Circle would be.

|             | Authenticity | Planet First | People First |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
|   Score   |      80%     |      50%     |      30%     |
| Reliability |      80%     |      60%     |      10%     |


Reliability is another word for variation, this is to show the consistency of the answers, the higher the more people vote the same. If not enough people have voted then reliability is also not high. E.g. most people voting they don't know lowers reliability, only having 2 people answering does as well, 90% being negative, 10% negative would lead to high reliability if e.g more than 20 people answered.
