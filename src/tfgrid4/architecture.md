## Architecture

![image alt text](img/40_1.png)

Each participant (user and/or farmer) of the TFGrid will need  3Bot which can be hosted home or on any of the TFNodes in the TFGrid. 

There are 2 blockchains who support the operation, one dealing with all money and identity matters, the others with the DAOâ€™s and validation functionality of the TFGrid.

The 3Bots communicate on behalf of the users with the TFGrid or any of the blockchains.
