# Passion

I love my work and I love to code...

I love life and being in energy-rich places.

I love to be with my wife Isabelle, my beautiful daughters, friends and our core community which became true family. It's so cool to build a future together.

I love spending time in Zanzibar and The Nile, to connect to likeminded human souls who want the best for this planet and all people on it.

I love to surf the mysterious waves of life.

Ah yes, I love to be on the ocean, sailing, kiting, ...  Sailing is so beautiful, your world becomes super small and all too big at the same time.
