We had the honor to co-author this book which we are very proud off.

We honestly believe that the teachings of Bernard are a fundamental tool towards a better world.

Its a small book with a lot of content, if you want to have a copy let us know.

We are working on a project which will probably be called "project mycelium" which is all about delivering a digital backbone (built on top of ThreeFold tech) in line with the paradigm shifts as described in this book.
