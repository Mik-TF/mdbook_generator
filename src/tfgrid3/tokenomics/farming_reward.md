# Farming Reward TFGrid 3.14 

The amount of ThreeFold_Token earned by farmers is relative to the amount of compute, storage or network capacity they provide to the ThreeFold Grid.

### 1. Proof-of-Capacity

The reward is in line with capacity provided by the farmer based on:

* Compute Capacity (CPU)
* Memory Capacity (RAM)
* Storage Capacity (SSD/HDD)

- There are maximum 1 Billion TFT farmed (new from 3.14)
- Once we reach the 1 billion TFT farming will stop and all reward will be utilization based and rewards based on achievements based on location, quality, ... (the cooperative and GEP's will define this future)
