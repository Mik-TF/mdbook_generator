# ThreeFold Cooperative

ThreeFold Dubai would like to hand over the day2day operation of the TFGrid to a cooperative.

- Cooperative are very trustworthy decentralized structures which allow upto millions of people to be part of a common goal.
- Cooperative members vote for their directors which might be the Cooperative Founders
- Untill this is done we keep on operating from ThreeFold DMCC

## Cooperative Founder

TF Dubai is looking for 9 ThreeFold Cooperative Founders to setup the COOP Structure.

## Cooperative Director

Are voted by the members, but at start are the same as the 9 Founders.

They are like the board of a Cooperative and need to structure how the Cooperative Members will vote and be part of the governance.
The Cooperative will have a team which will do the day2day for the TFGrid.

The Cooperative is funded by utilization of the grid (40% at start).

Cooperative Directors and the team are renumerated for their contributions.

- TFCoop Founders will work with TFTech for technical implementation of membership (as NFT), ...
