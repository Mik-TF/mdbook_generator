# Grid Enhancement Proposal

GEP stands for Grid Enhancement Proposal. 

A GEP is a document (can be on forum) providing information to the ThreeFold community, or describing a new feature for the TFGrid or its processes or any other change as is managed by the TF DAO. 


## Requirements before a GEP can be voted

- The why and how needs to be well enough defined and specified
- The GEP always needs to be in line with planet/people first values
- There needs to be a forum post linked to it which gave people the time to discuss the GEP
- The GEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature if relevant.

## Process

- A GEP gets registered in TFChain. 
- Community has to approve a GEP
- Guardians can block a GEP and ask for a re-vote and explain why re-vote is needed
  - e.g. if mistake in process would have been made
  - e.g. if something would happen which puts any of the entities related to TF in danger, e.g. not in line with T&C (legally)
  - e.g. if values are not followed (planet/people first)
  - e.g. if a change violates our security (e.g. introduction of non opensource in our TF Stack)
  - e.g. if a change has potential to damage someone in our community
- Guardians and or TFCoop Team will implement

## Voting Power

- 1 TFT, 1 Vote (NEW for TFGrid 3.14 and still needs to be voted by a GEP at March 21 2024)
