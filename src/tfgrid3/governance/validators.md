# Validators

Validators & staking as is happening in TFGrid 3.14.

- 9 [guardians](tfgrid3:guardians.md) are needed
- they run a full TF Validator Stack (technically)
- anyone can stake TFT on that stack

reward

- 10 percent of revenue over TFGrid in TFT or INCA
- this percentage can change over time and will be voted by GEP
- a validator gets a monthly income to support his/her work as well in e.g. INCA or TFT

## what is deployed on a validator

- TFChain Node (our blockchain node)
- TFHub (let people go from docker to tfgrid ZOS flists)
- TFBootstrap (how to install new node)
- Explorer (has all stats)
- Validator Code (keep the grid clean & healthy)
- Monitoring Software
- Bridges (needs to be migrated carefully, might take some time)
