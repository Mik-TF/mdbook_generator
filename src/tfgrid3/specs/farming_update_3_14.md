# Farming Logic Update 3.14

> this is for TFGrid version 3.14, and will still change because of feedback on our [forum](https://forum.threefold.io/t/feedback-on-farming-logic-as-suggested-for-tfgrid-3-14/4275)

## FARMING REWARDS

- [x] farming reward stays the same, price on 0.08
- [ ] max 1billion TFT on Stellar
- [ ] uptime checks include network, min BW, quality of HW (needs to be further specified)
- [ ] all farmers have done KYC/AML
- [ ] for new nodes: we do no register nodes which are not DDR4... 
- [ ] bigger farmers can sign with DMCC for SLA, which will be visible, with penalty in locked tokens by TF DMCC/COOP, there is contract involved, which gets linked to TFChain
- [ ] if price > 0.08 for more than 30 days, then the farming price changes ...

The cooperative will resell capacity (using TFT at back) and redistribute margin as follows:

- [ ] give 50% on utilization to farmers
- [ ] give 10% on utilization to the stakers on the validators
- [ ] give 40% on utilization to treasury of TF Cooperative

[more info about coop see here](tfcoop_intro.md).

## UI & EXPLORER

- [ ] track more info about nodes in explorer, easier for people to select which node is good one
- [ ] info about mem, cpu, ... 
- [ ] unified way how to query nodes in UI
- [ ] show that farmers are having SLA & link to their contract with TF DMCC or TF COOP

## GOVERNANCE

- [ ] 1 tft = 1 vote


## GEP 1 NEEDED

- [ ] stop burning
- [ ] agree on 1 billion TFT cap (farming will stop)
- [ ] farming rules as above
- [ ] utilization revenue distribution through cooperative see above

## GEP 2 NEEDED

Will be done once voting system has been changed and GEP 1 done

- [ ] agree on 9 directors for cooperative

## GEP 3 NEEDED

Will be done once voting system has been changed and GEP 1 done

- [ ] agree on 9 guardians who run the validators
