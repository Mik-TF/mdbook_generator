## Need to bring this project alive.

- small website which explains why this is important tech
- show how it runs on TFGrid
- its own digital payment token is called MKO

## narrative

- the cost of 1h streaming is between 0.1 and 2 USD per hour
- the only way how streaming can be paid for is MKO
- one of the partners it he TFGrid who has low latency high bandwidth available

## starting treasury

- 1 MKO = 0.1 USD at start
- maximum amount of MKO ever = 1 billion (this is trillion USD market)
- initial MKO = 100 million
  - this represents only 1,141 concurrent high quality streams during a year at pricing of launch
- distribution
  - 40%: salaries and operational costs to deliver the platform: growing to 250k USD per month
  - 40%: storage, network, compute GPU (towards cloud providers)
  - 10%: legal, company, compliance, auditing
  - 10%: team (vesting over 4 years)

## MKO token details

- availability for 2024: only on our own portal, after that the appropriate (exchange) strategy will be defined
- legal: 1 MKO is a promise by Mkondo to deliver VR/Metaverse streaming over the years to come at pricing as defined
- MKO willbe made created as we run out of capacity of concurrent streams for max 2 months
  - e.g. there is capacity for 1,141 concurrent high quality streams, then there can be maximum of ```1,141 * 24 * 365 =  10 million hours = 100 million MKO```
  - imagine we need 1500 concurrent streams for 12 months, this means we need 150 million MKO, so 50 million need to be created if the price of MKO would still be 0.2 USD.
- There can never be more than 1 billion MKO

## VR/Metaverse streaming pricing at launch Q1 2025

- at lauch the MKO will be priced at 0.2 USD
- 3D VR/Metaverse super realistic quality: 10 MKO per hour
- 3D VR/Metaverse std quality: 1 MKO per hour
- 2D std quality: 0.05 MKO per hour (0.05 USD)

## Bizmodel

- education, promotion industry can use this super high quality to deliver content to their users, they can decide to pay on behalf of their users

## structure

- run from TFDMCC for now with contracts from there
- put in contract it will be spinn off to another company and that we have the right to do so
