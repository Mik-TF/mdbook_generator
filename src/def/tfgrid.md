# TFGrid

Our ThreeFold grid which is the interconnected network of all Zero-OS powered TFNodes which deliver compute, storage, network, gpu, loadbalancing, dns, ... services.

### Details

ThreeFold_Grid is a global, neutral, and sustainable network of autonomous storage and compute Internet capacity created by ThreeFold Farmers.

On this Grid, IT capacity is indexed / registered on the TFChain for easy discovery by purchasers. Any application which can run on Linux can run on the TF Grid but with more privacy, security, closer to the end-user, and at a much lower cost.

This Internet capacity is produced and allocated locally - similar to the way electricity and other utilities are purchased today. This allows any digital service or application provider to host their services and applications in proximity to the end user leading to significantly greater performance, a lower price point and better margins. This is both more cost effective and green.
