# IncaFuel

INCA Fuel is our peer2peer mutual credit currency which is the result of people buying/selling Services (cloud, internet bandwidth, energy, â€¦) on the @TFGRID. 
The only way INCA Fuel can be bought is through @INCA. 

TF has partnered with Holochain to realize this capability. 

INCA Fuel will make us unlimitedly scalable and will work even when connections to the main global Internet are not too slow or not available e.g. in a remote area.

IncaFuel at start corresponds with the price of 1 INCA.
