# Tanzania's New Sovereign Internet

The current centralised Internet model gives companies access to the data of hundreds of millions of citizens, making people the products. Corporations have immense power in influencing the population and gain financially from this model with Tanzania losing +10 billion USD per year because of not having their own sovereign internet.

Dunia Yetu wants to change this model by helping Tanzania to build their own sovereign internet infrastructure where the people are in control and are the ones to benefit from their own internet. We are using the ThreeFold Grid to accomplish this. 

ThreeFold is a globally-distributed grid of storage, compute, and network capacity, acting as “no middleman” Internet resources between independent capacity providers and users. The ThreeFold Grid is formed by Farmers, independent people who connect Nodes (decentralised Internet capacity) anywhere electricity and network are present. Together, they form a globally distributed Internet infrastructure and earn income in the form of TFT.

**Dunia Yetu will provide a new internet that is:**

- **Affordable:** This new internet will cost $1-$5 a month whereas the current internet model costs a minimum of $30 monthly 
- **Fast and efficient:** Internet capacity is produced and allocated locally allowing local content hosting and increasing speeds
- **Accessible:** With the Internet being localized and more affordable, accessibility for everyone will be greatly enhanced
- **Reliable:** As this Internet is decentralised, when one component fails the system continues to operate
- **Secure:** It provides enhanced security, reducing single points of failure, enhancing data privacy, and offering resilience against cyberattacks
- **Co-owned:** All users co-own this new Internet and participate in decision making 
- **Sustainable:** The most sustainable Internet infrastructure worldwide. The current model consumes 5-10% of the world’s energy
