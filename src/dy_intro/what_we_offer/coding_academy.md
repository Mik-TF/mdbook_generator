# Dunia Yetu Coding Academy

This new internet must be built by Tanzanians, allowing citizens to create the digital solutions that their communities need. 

Our team is dedicated to fostering technological empowerment within Tanzania’s local communities through the establishment of a Coding Academy. This initiative aims to provide accessible and inclusive learning opportunities, equipping individuals with valuable tech skills that are increasingly essential in today's digital landscape. Our Coding Academy will serve as a dynamic hub where community members can engage in immersive learning experiences, participate in hackathons, and attend hands-on coding workshops. By creating a supportive environment that encourages collaboration and innovation, we aspire to empower individuals to navigate the ever-evolving world of technology and contribute meaningfully to Tanzania’s digital realm. Through this endeavour, we envision a community that not only embraces technological advancements but actively shapes and drives them.

Our first Coding Academy will be based in Dar es Salaam, with further branches opening across Tanzania in the future. The Dunia Yetu Coding Academy will organise workshops on IT fundamentals as well as advanced tech including web development, AI and Blockchain. Learn the skills you need to participate in Tanzania’s new Internet.
