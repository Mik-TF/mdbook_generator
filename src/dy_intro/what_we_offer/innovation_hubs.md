# Dunia Yetu Innovation Hubs

To facilitate the Dunia Yetu project and empower local communtiies around Tanzania we are creating Innovation Hubs across the country. 

We are building a network of distributed innovation hubs around Tanzania which will feature: 
- Event spaces
- Education facilities
- Connected IT resources
Recording studio for VR, AR and Metaverse

These hubs will provide a communal space for community members to convene, serving as a versatile coworking space as well as hosting Dunia Yetu Coding Academy hackathons and workshops. 

Hubs will have internet generators locally installed providing internet for all community members. The concept will be sustainable and environmentally friendly through the introduction of solar panels and earth regenerators:
