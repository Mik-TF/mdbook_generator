# Join Our Coding Academy

Dunia Yetu is working to create the curriculum for our Coding Academy. 

Once a week we will hold online workshops to discover: 
- How to build a peer2peer app for practical day2day requirements for Tanzania and Zanzibar
- How to host the Internet of the Future, how to participate in and build on it
- How to build reliable code, do continuous delivery & integration on top of this new Internet
- How to build the most modern websites and e-commerce experiences in no time
Practical Sovereign AI

Hackathons will be held twice a month in person in Dar, providing opportunities for community members to collaborate together. A summer camp is being developed for talented participants in Tanzania. 

We will be hiring 5 researchers / trainers to help deploy this programme across Tanzania. An update is coming soon with regards to onboarding.
