## Build on top of Tanzania’s decentralised internet 

**True digital sovereignty for open-source builders**

Tanzania has the opportunity to leverage the ThreeFold network to develop impactful solutions that not only benefit individuals but also contribute to the overall advancement of their local communities. Our aspiration is to empower Tanzanian developers to construct programs and products tailored to Tanzania’s specific needs. Envision the creation of a music streaming platform that addresses royalty issues or the potential of a decentralised Uber model within our internet framework, eliminating unnecessary intermediaries. Through these initiatives, our goal is to enable Tanzanian creators and entrepreneurs to unlock the full potential of our internet infrastructure for the greater good.
