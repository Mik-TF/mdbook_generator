
### Why?

Current Linux-based operating systems are challenging to use safely and efficiently on the edges of the Internet. They require central management, involve excessive complexity, and prove difficult to update and maintain, resulting in numerous security vulnerabilities. To revolutionize the internet, we must rethink how we host our applications, essentially reinventing the concept of a cloud-based operating system.

### What?

An innovative operating system, retaining the Linux kernel but fundamentally redesigned for heightened security, efficiency, and support for true peer-to-peer and decentralized workloads.

This unique operating system doesn't require installation on hard disks or SSDs; it remains stateless, consistently up to date, and autonomously managed without human intervention. Its design enables self-healing application delivery, opening new possibilities in system resilience and reliability.

### Benefits?

- **Compatibility with Existing Workloads:** Our primary goal is to ensure Zero-OS compatibility with over 99% of the workloads commonly hosted in centralized cloud environments today. This includes support for Docker containers, virtual machines, Kubernetes, and more.
- **Reduced Attack Surface:** Zero-OS boasts a smaller hacking surface, enhancing security by minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
- **Stateless Design:** Its statelessness simplifies deployment and updates, making it easier to maintain while ensuring it's always up to date.
- **Autonomous Operation:** Whether you have one instance or a billion, Zero-OS operates autonomously, streamlining management and maintaining consistency across all instances.
- **Rapid Deployment:** With Zero-OS, you can deploy 1000 virtual machines in just 2 minutes, ensuring agility and efficiency in scaling up resources.
- **Unique Security Features:** Zero-OS offers support for distinctive security features to enhance protection and fortify your infrastructure.
- **Lower Cost, Easier to Maintain:** Zero-OS significantly reduces the operational expenses associated with cloud infrastructure by automating most processes. This results in minimal operational costs and eliminates the need for extensive engineering efforts.
- **Ready for a Decentralized World:** Zero-OS empowers individuals to become hosts for required Internet capacity (storage, network, compute, gpu), allowing them to be rewarded for providing computing resources and internet connectivity. This aligns with the vision of a truly decentralized and distributed computing ecosystem.

### Status?
