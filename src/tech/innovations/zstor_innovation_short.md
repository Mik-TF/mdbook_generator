## Zero-Stor : a quantum safe backend storage system.

### Why?

Traditional backend storage systems have their roots in centralized environments, focusing on low-latency and closed security setups. However, these characteristics make them less suitable for use in decentralized cloud contexts.

Newer-generation storage systems like protocol-driven or blockchain-based solutions may face scalability and performance limitations and may not fulfill certain critical requirements that we consider essential.

### What?

A redesigned storage system which can scale to planet level, is super secure private and fast enough for more usecases. Its designed to operate in a decentralized context. Data can never be lost of corrupted.

This storage system is a backend storage system, cannot be used by end users, its meant to be integrated with a front end storage system like e.g. S3 or a filesystem (see next section).


### Benefits?


- **Data Resilience:** Ensures data is never lost or corrupted.
- **Planetary Scalability:** Capable of scaling to a global level.
- **Cost-Efficient:** Offers exceptional cost efficiency.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for various use cases, including archiving, backup, files, and CDNs.
- **Low Overhead:** Requires only a 20% overhead for building a storage network where any four nodes can be lost simultaneously, compared to a 400% overhead in traditional storage systems.
- **Security and Privacy:** Provides robust security, even impervious to quantum computers.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Users have complete control over data placement.
- **Empowering Front-End Applications:** Can be integrated into various front-end storage applications, such as blockchains, archives, or S3.
- **CDN Support:** Functions effectively as a backend for CDN applications, facilitating content delivery.
- **Sustainability:** Uses 10 times less energy compared to traditional storage systems, contributing to sustainability efforts.
- **Locality Aware:** Data can be delivered to where the users are ideal for sovereign usecases.


### Status?

- Zero-OS has been in beta for over four years, with continuous development and improvement.
- A notable deployment in Switzerland, with over 50 petabytes of storage capacity, served as a substantial test environment, although it's no longer active.
- Within the current TFGrid network, there's an impressive capacity of over 20 petabytes available for use.
- Lacking some monitoring, documentation ... will be added in TFGrid 3.15
- Previous releases have been successfully utilized by major government organizations on a massive scale (hundreds of petabytes), providing strong evidence of the concept's viability and effectiveness.
