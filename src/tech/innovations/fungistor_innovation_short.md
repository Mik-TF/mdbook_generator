### Why?

Existing blockchain, internet, and P2P content delivery and storage systems suffer from sluggish performance and are too expensive. Content retrieval is often slow, and the overhead for ensuring redundancy is excessive. We require innovative approaches to facilitate efficient information sharing among users.

Content delivery frequently represents the most significant expense for social networks. Running a basic social video network for 10 million users currently costs approximately $2 million per month using traditional cloud providers. We have the potential to reduce this cost by several orders of magnitude.


### What?

FungiStor is a peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery layer designed to store and distribute an extensive range of objects, including images, videos, files, and more. It has the capability to handle trillions of objects and files efficiently. FungiStor serves as an excellent solution for content delivery networks (CDNs), significantly reducing costs for organizations seeking to stream or deliver substantial data volumes to their user base.

Furthermore, FungiStor will act as the backend infrastructure for the Flists within our own system. However, it is versatile and can be utilized by anyone in need of a global-level content delivery system for files, objects, and images.

### Benefits?

- **Global Scalability, Sub-50ms Lookups:** FungiStor scales worldwide with ultra-fast data retrieval under 50 milliseconds.
- **Localized Content Delivery:** Prioritizes local data access for optimized speed and efficiency.
- **Quantum-Safe Security:** Incorporates robust quantum security measures.
