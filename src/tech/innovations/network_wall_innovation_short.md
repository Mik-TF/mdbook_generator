### Why?

Traditional firewalls are increasingly ineffective in addressing modern security challenges. They struggle to mitigate emerging threats, particularly against backdoors and man-in-the-middle attacks. Backdoors can render firewalls obsolete as attackers find ways to bypass them. New, innovative approaches to cybersecurity are necessary to address these evolving security problems.

## What?

Imagine a scenario where you deploy applications within secure, liquid-cooled physical containers or smaller POD's that operate without relying on traditional TCP/IP or Ethernet protocols. By avoiding the use of standard low-level protocols, the existing backdoors are unable to communicate with the external world.

Incoming traffic is intercepted at the application level and securely transported into the protected environment through physical communication mechanisms based on RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access). The integration of this solution into Zero-OS ensures a seamless and transparent experience for developers and system administrators.

It's important to note that this solution is primarily intended for commercial use cases, but its existence is valuable knowledge in the realm of cybersecurity and network security.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security and Privacy:** The solution offers significantly improved security and privacy measures, mitigating potential risks and vulnerabilities.
- **Ultra-Fast Connectivity:** Within the POD/Container, the connectivity is exceptionally fast, ensuring rapid data transfer and application performance.
- **Robust Data and Application-Aware Proxies:** Secure proxies between the Internet and the protected backend application provide an additional layer of security, safeguarding data and ensuring application-level awareness.
- **Seamless Integration:** The solution is designed for ease of integration within existing environments, minimizing disruptions and complexities during implementation.
