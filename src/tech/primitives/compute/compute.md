## TFGrid Compute Layer

![](img/tfgrid_compute_.jpg)

We are more than just Container or VM technology.

Default features:

- compatible with Docker
- compatible with any VM (Virtual Machine)
- compatible with any Linux workload
- integrated unique storage & network primitives

We have following unique advantages:

- no need to work with images, we work with our unique ZOS FS
- every container runs in a dedicated virtual machine providing more security
- the containers talk to each other over a private network (mycelium)
- the containers can use a web gatewat to allow users on the internet connect to the applications as running in their secure containers 
- can use core-x to manage the workload
