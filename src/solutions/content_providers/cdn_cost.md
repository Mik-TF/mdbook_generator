## high CDN cost = Content Delivery

- CDN's cost between 20 and 60 on major CDN's from Amazon, Google, ..., after negotiation and willingness to park lots of money and commit per month it mught be certain discount.
- Other specialized CDN's can be around 10 per TB if services from e.g. Europe or US, smaller CDN's are much more expensive.
- Managing these CDN's is expensive and not easy job.

>> this means to service 10m people it would cost about 1 to 2m USD per month just for CDN alone.
