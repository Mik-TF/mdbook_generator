# Solution for Content or Social Network Providers

Content providers have quite some issues in supporting their user base, our approach can help.

Below you can find how we can help you to resolve some of your possible issues.

## lower your CDN cost = Content Delivery

- costs typically are +50 USD per TB, our solution goes below 10 USD.
- cost goes to 10 USD at start, from v2.0 can be even lower.
- see [Costs of CDN's](cdn_cost.md)
 
## Lower your cost of operations

- ThreeFold has developed a self healing capable system which lowers your cost of operation dramatically.

## Avoid any control or interference from others

- Our clouds are unbreakable and cannot be shutdown or interfered with.

## Get more scale

- There are no limits to how far you can scale your app.

## Sideload your mobile apps

Vendors like Apple have a lot to say on how you deploy your app, we can work around that:

- one app will be called TFConnect and will be the app running the peer2peer network Mycelium, identity management, reputation management, reliable message bus, geo dns, content caching,... TFConnect will be available for all major desktop and mobile platforms.
- Then there will be multiple apps which can be native and web, the apps will talk to TFConnect on the device or desktop.
- We suggest to also develop a rich web app which connects on the Phone to TFConnect, this cannot be blocked and would be ideal fall back solution in case the native mobile app gets blocked. Current web technology can be made in such a way it would act almost the same compared to native, thanks to TFConnect it would still be fast and highly responsive.

## Integrated solution for GDPR

- By design resolved in 2.0, all data is owned by the user.

## Redundancy / Uptime

- Its possible to achieve 100% redundant and should never be able to go down.
