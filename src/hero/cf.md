## Why this way

The primary concern with services like Facebook, Tiktok,... is their business model, which hinges on monetizing user data and attention. 

Users, instead of being customers, become the product: 
- their personal information, preferences, and online behavior are collected, analyzed, and sold to advertisers.
- this raises serious privacy concerns but also leads to a platform ecosystem designed to maximize user engagement often at the cost of mental well-being and social cohesion. 
  
In contrast, a model where users pay for network, storage and computing resources promotes a more equitable and privacy-respecting environment. 

In such a system, the users are co-creators of an ecosystem, not the product. This approach fosters a sense of collective ownership and responsibility, as everyone contributes to the maintenance and improvement of the service. It also encourages the development of features and policies that genuinely benefit the user community, rather than prioritizing ad revenue. 

By paying directly for the services we use, we can create a healthier, more sustainable, and user-focused internet ecosystem.

**Your membership fee is 100% used to provide and enhance the services of the network and provided applications. Transparent reporting will be setup to demonstrate the utilization of the funds.**

## Become a Internet Farmer

Becoming a "farmer" or "miner" of compute, storage, and network capacity involves contributing your own hardware resources to our decentralized network. 

> We are not a crypto project ! We are structured as a cooperative where all members help their peers with 100% transparent reward model. 

Here's how you can become a part of this ecosystem:

1. **Acquiring Hardware**: Start by acquiring the necessary hardware. This includes computers with sufficient processing power, storage devices, and a reliable internet connection. You can buy the hardware from our cooperative and as part of the crowd funding.

2. **Providing Resources**: Once connected, your system will start contributing its resources (storage, compute, or network bandwidth) to the network. Your role as a 'farmer' is to ensure that your system is running smoothly and is reliably connected to the network.

3. **Earning Rewards**: You are incentivized for the amount and quality of resources provided.

4. **Extending the Network**: By contributing your resources, you're helping to extend the network's capacity. This expanded capacity enables more users to access sovereign internet applications without relying on traditional centralized models where they might be the product.

5. **Promoting Sovereignty**: Your participation helps promote a more sovereign and autonomous internet, where users have greater control over their data and are not subject to the whims of large corporations. It contributes to an ecosystem where services are user-centric and privacy-focused.

By becoming a farmer in this system, you're not just providing a service; you're part of a movement towards a more decentralized, user-empowered internet. This approach can potentially reshape how we interact with the online world, prioritizing user privacy, ownership, and control over personal data.
