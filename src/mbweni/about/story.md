## Our Story

Formerly known as the Jungle Paradise Resort, 2024 marked a profound shift in our vision and purpose at Mbweni. In this transformation time, we aspire to transform Mbweni from a commercial resort into a regeneration hub; a thriving community woven together by a shared dedication to history, nature, and the boundless possibilities of regeneration. We would like to invite you to join hands in crafting a narrative that transcends time.

More than just a resort, Mbweni is a coliving space where individuals come together to form a dynamic and interconnected community. Here, guests are not merely visitors but active participants in shaping the vibrant culture and ethos of Mbweni.

## Our Philosophy

At Mbweni, we live by the mantra "Create, Play, Grow." We wholeheartedly believe in the power of co-creation, the joy of play, and the constant pursuit of personal growth. This mantra encapsulates our commitment to fostering a community where creativity knows no bounds, where the spirit of play is celebrated for everyone, and where growth extends beyond individual aspirations to embrace the collective flourishing of both people and the environment.


## Our Commitment

More than just a hospitality establishment; as a regenerative hub, we are committed to setting a model for transformative change within the broader landscape of the industry.

We pledge to cultivate a harmonious community that fosters creating impact, personal growth, and at the same time, having a good time. This is our pathway towards regenerative living, where the essence lies in not just sustaining but actively contributing to the well-being of our community and the places we touch.
