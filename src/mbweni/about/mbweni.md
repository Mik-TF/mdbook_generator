# About Mbweni Ruins and Gardens

Welcome to Mbweni Ruins and Gardens, formerly known as Jungle Paradise. Situated in the heart of Zanzibar, we are more than just a resort – we are a vibrant and experimental regeneration hub. Our mission is to inspire, nurture, and embrace sustainable tourism as a catalyst for transformation. At Mbweni, we're not only dedicated to providing a memorable experience for our guests but also to making a positive impact on our community and the environment.

## Location

Located in the upmarket suburb of Mbweni, just 5km south of Zanzibar Town, our establishment holds a rich historical significance. Once a base for the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) and a settlement for former slaves in the 19th century, Mbweni is steeped in history. The ruins of St Mary’s School for Girls, originally built by missionaries for girls freed from slave ships, now stand amidst the lush gardens of Mbweni Ruins Hotel. While it may be a trek from Stone Town, a visit to Mbweni is well worth it, offering visitors the chance to explore this evocative spot and enjoy the amenities of the hotel, including its restaurant and private beach.

Nearby, visitors can also find St John's Anglican Church, another poignant reminder of Zanzibar's colonial missionary era. The caretaker-guide, a direct descendant of a freed slave who became the UMCA's first African deacon, offers insights into the church's history and significance.
