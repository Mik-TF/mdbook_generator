## About Kilimanjaro

Mount Kilimanjaro is a dormant volcanic mountain located in Tanzania, East Africa. It is the tallest freestanding mountain in the world, rising approximately 5,895 meters (19,341 feet) above sea level. Kilimanjaro is comprised of three volcanic cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. The summit of Kilimanjaro, known as Uhuru Peak, is situated on Kibo, the tallest of the three cones.
