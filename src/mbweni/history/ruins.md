# History of Mbweni Ruins

Located in the serene coastal region of Mbweni, the ruins of Mbweni hold a significant historical and cultural legacy that dates back centuries. Originally established as a settlement for freed slaves in the 19th century, Mbweni served as a base for the Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA), an organization dedicated to education and Christian missionary work in East Africa.

The ruins of Mbweni include remnants of St Maryâ€™s School for Girls, which was founded by missionaries to provide education and refuge for girls rescued from slave ships. The school played a crucial role in the emancipation of slaves and the promotion of education in the region during a tumultuous period of East African history.

Culturally and historically, Mbweni represents a beacon of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The ruins stand as a testament to the struggles and triumphs of those who sought refuge and redemption in this coastal enclave. The site serves as a poignant reminder of the horrors of the slave trade and the resilience of those who fought against it.

Today, the ruins of Mbweni are preserved as part of Mbweni Ruins and Gardens, a vibrant community and regeneration hub dedicated to sustainable tourism and cultural preservation. The site has been transformed into a peaceful retreat, where visitors can explore the remnants of the past and immerse themselves in the natural beauty of the surrounding botanical gardens.

Mbweni Ruins and Gardens serves as a living testament to the enduring legacy of Mbweni and its importance in East African history. Through preservation and interpretation, the site continues to educate and inspire visitors from around the world, ensuring that the lessons of the past are not forgotten.
