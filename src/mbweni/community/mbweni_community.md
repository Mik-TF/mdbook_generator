## Maasai Guards: Respecting Local Culture and Tradition

## About the Maasai

The Maasai are a semi-nomadic ethnic group inhabiting the regions of Kenya and Tanzania. Renowned for their distinctive attire, which includes vibrant shukas (blankets) and intricate beadwork, the Maasai have a rich cultural heritage that spans centuries. Traditionally, the Maasai are pastoralists, relying on cattle herding as their primary livelihood. They are known for their strong sense of community, oral traditions, and deep connection to the land.

Employing Maasai guards at Mbweni Ruins and Gardens not only enhances security but also serves as a tribute to the rich cultural diversity of Tanzania and Zanzibar. It reflects Mbweni's commitment to fostering an inclusive and respectful community that honors and celebrates the traditions of the local people.
