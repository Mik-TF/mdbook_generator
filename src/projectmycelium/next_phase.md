## We are ready to go to our next phase

### Phase 1: We made the technology work

#### ThreeFold Grid is alive and the most incredible technology has been proven to work.

We had to achieve what seemed impossible. Can we develop a new foundational layer that could serve as the base layer for any web2 or web3 project in the world to deploy upon? Can we tackle and potentially resolve some of the most challenging issues for the infrastructure layer that empowers our digital life?

We needed to develop a sort of super cloud as an alternative to the centralized clouds like Amazon and Google. This supercloud can grow to planetary scale and can be provided by everyone without technical knowledge. It can  run autonomously and it has the potential to run any Internet web2 and web3 workloads.

It has taken us over 20 years to prove that:

* A new Physical Server Operating System can be developed, which is autonomous and can be deployed by anyone, anywhere, establishing a new foundation on top of which applications can run.
* A new Storage System can be created which is more efficient, hyper scalable and cannot be hacked, not even by quantum computers.
* A new Network System can be created which has the power to let us communicate over any possible medium (5G, fiber, satellite), is end-to-end encrypted, is capable of restoring any broken connection in real time, and is always looking for the shortest path between participants on this network.

#### To arrive at this point:

* Over the past two decades, 7 companies have been created with the goal of tackling some of these challenging problems. These companies have since been acquired by larger corporations, and their technology is widely used today, significantly contributing to the Internet.
* Within ThreeFold itself, $50,000,000 has been invested by our community members, TF farmers, and technology companies. The TFT token symbolizes the collective effort of our ecosystem.
* The TFT has played a crucial role in enabling the funding and growth of this highly ambitious project. The maximum supply of TFT is set at 1,000,000,000 TFT, which we anticipate reaching in the coming months. Currently, our market capitalization stands at just $15,000,000.
* A venture creator has been established in Mauritius with a focus on emerging countries to deploy this new type of Internet system, and two countries have already signed up for it.
* We have developed additional incredible technologies to address the challenges associated with this radically new approach.

### Phase 2: We go viral

> let's buy our tokens back and deploy +10,000 additional nodes

It's now time to go viral, we want to use the power of human networks to expand and grow our project before going mainstream in phase 3.

Our aim for phase 2:

* Deploy +10,000 additional nodes in the field. Already today, we have probably the biggest network of compute and storage capacity in the world. That being said, we want to grow this 50x.
* Create a network of +10,000 like minded souls who will be the base of this revolution which has the power to reshape how we communicate and build our future digital life.
* Buy as many TFT as we can to have them when we enter Phase 3.

We now have the capability to truly build our own Internet where we build our own communication, compute, storage and network layer. Imagine the possibilities: true freedom.

### Phase 3: We go mainstream = ThreeFold will be launched on a global base.

It's now time to go mainstream, we are looking for a team who will bring our project forward and make sure the world knows about it. In parallel to Phase 2, fundraising is going on to empower our global commercial launch.  This team will make sure the world knows about ThreeFold and the importance of our project.

This phase will be mainly in parallel to Phase 2 and we expect Phase 3 to start within 3 to 6 months from now.

DePIN is happening and growing right now,

In our opinion, we are just at the beginning of the journey for DePIN. ThreeFold has more alive compute and storage capacity and more foundational relevant technology compared to any projects displayed above.

We are not a competitor: we deliver a layer which is needed by all those projects. We are a true decentralized cloud layer which can serve as a basis for all those projects. 

**Each of the players above can be deployed on top of ThreeFold, while ThreeFold can not live on top of them. **

**With appropriate team and funding, we have all it takes to be a top 10 player.**
