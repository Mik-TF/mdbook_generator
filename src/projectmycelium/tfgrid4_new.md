The TF Grid (our next generation of our decentralized cloud) has some incredible new features

## TF Router

A new capability is being introduced called the TF Router, which is a 5G, Meshed Wireless and Satellite Router which allows everyone to become a Network Service Provider. The TF Router will always look for the shortest path between all our participants and has the capability to use any of the physical internet connections to provide best performance and uptime. The INCA Routers can even build a meshed wireless network which means we can bring the internet to the most remote areas in the world.


## INCA Generator provides passive income

Combination of Cloud, Internet & Electricity

An INCA Generator provides Cloud, Internet and Electricity to the people around and is the combination of one or more TF Routers, TF Nodes, and optional solar electricity production. The INCA Generator provides a passive income in INCA for the owner.

## INCA Fuel

INCA Fuel is our peer2peer mutual credit currency which is the result of people buying/selling Services (cloud, internet bandwidth, energy, …) on the TF Grid. 

The only way INCA Fuel can be bought is through INCA. We partner with Holochain to realize this capability. INCA Fuel will make us unlimitedly scalable and will work even when connections to the main global Internet are not too slow or not available e.g. in a remote area.


## New Features in Zero-OS

Our Zero-OS which is our underlying close to metal Operating System gets new features

- Zero-OS natively supports GPU and other AI workloads.
- Zero-OS can be run in a Virtual Machine, which will allow faster expansion.
- Zero-OS will be able to run Full VM, Thin VM and now also Containers directly in Zero-OS.
- Zero-OS will support a new faster storage system for virtual mounts  (SSD/HDD) 

## INCA Marketplace

We introduce our INCA Marketplace which will allow people to buy our TF Grid products and services using credit cards, digital currencies, … Underneath of course everything goes back to INCA as the reserve currency. 

The INCA Marketplace will have a simplified API which allows our partners to buy and sell services more easily and of course in line with all required regulations.

Every farmer will be able to price their product and services.
