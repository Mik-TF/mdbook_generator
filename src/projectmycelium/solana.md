## Solana

ThreeFold will be joining the Solana ecosystem quite soon (timing TBD) and will launch a set of nice products on Solana.

- INCA = 	Internet Capacity token (100% backwards compatible with TFT)
- HERO NFT = 	your autonomous sovereign digital self, with a slot for a unique name
    - can be connected to a legal entity (company) in a digital freezone.
    - let your hero on your behalf deal with your digital life, own digital assets, manage 
	- your communication & social life, use AI, make bookings, etc
- INCA GEN  =  	a TF Node or the new TF Router packaged as an NFT
    - The INCA GEN NFT generates a monthly passive income in INCA
    - An INCA GENERATOR is linked to a region where there is demand for cloud

There will be 4 Billion INCA, each TFT (ThreeFold Token) can buy 3 INCA. 

The reserve in INCA is used for airdrops to develop the ecosystem, do promotion, deploy capacity,

> Every INCA spent as airdrop has a goal to extend the ecosystem so even more INCA are needed to follow the expanding ecosystem.
